# nQuery

**nQuery** is a next-gen, UX-first DOM engine that brings jQuery’s ergonomics to modern web apps:

- Chainable DOM helpers (`nq(selector)`) that feel familiar if you’ve used jQuery.
- Fine-grained **signals** (`nq.signal`) and **stores** for state and derived values.
- Built-in **query stores** (`nq.query`) for async data with caching and status flags.
- A small set of **UI primitives** (cards, buttons, modals, tabs, accordions, loadable wrappers, toasts, forms, virtual lists, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Optional **UX devtools + runtime lint** to catch accessibility and interaction issues early. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

This repo also includes a **marketing site + docs + playground** hosted as a static page (perfect for GitHub Pages).
